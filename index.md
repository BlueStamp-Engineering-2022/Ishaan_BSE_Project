# Robotic Arm
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was writing the code to be able to control the arduino using the HC06 module and my laptop. This required writing code in Python on my laptop and writing new code on the Arduino. I enjoyed writing the code, but I struggled with getting the Arduino to properly handle the messages from the HC06 module. Next, I plan on putting the robotic arm on a chassis so it can move.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was building the robotic arm, and get it moving with the controller. The parts required were the plastic chasis, an arduino, 4 servo motors, and and two joystick controllers. Then I had to upload the code for the controller to control the arduino onto the arduino. This code just read the joysticks position, and if it went above or below a certain limit, would tell the servo to move. I enjoyed constructing the arm, but I also struggled on parts of it because I required pliars to screw in the lock nuts.

# Starter Project

My Starter Project was the useless box. I soldered and learned that yes. The parts I used were a toggle switch, LED, and a PCB. I enjoyed soldering for the first time. I struggled screwing the screws into the corner posts and replacing the DC motor when it broke halfway through my project. I am looking forward to starting my intensive project
