# Robotic Arm
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My Final Milestone was creating the chassis for the arm. The chassis uses four DC motors and two motor drivers, which allows independent control over each wheel. It uses mecanum wheels, so it can move sideways as well as diagnally in addition to the stand front and back. I struggled with the wiring for all of the motors and motor drivers, and enjoyed writing the code to handle reading the instructions from the bluetooth module and using them to control the wheels.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was writing the code to be able to control the arduino using the HC06 module and my laptop. This required writing code in Python on my laptop and writing new code on the Arduino. I enjoyed writing the code, but I struggled with getting the Arduino to properly handle the messages from the HC06 module. Next, I plan on putting the robotic arm on a chassis so it can move.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was building the robotic arm, and get it moving with the controller. The parts required were the plastic chasis, an arduino, 4 servo motors, and and two joystick controllers. Then I had to upload the code for the controller to control the arduino onto the arduino. This code just read the joysticks position, and if it went above or below a certain limit, would tell the servo to move. I enjoyed constructing the arm, but I also struggled on parts of it because I required pliars to screw in the lock nuts.

# Starter Project

My Starter Project was the useless box. I soldered and learned about toggle switches and how they can power different circuits in different positions. The parts I used were a toggle switch, LED, and a PCB. I enjoyed soldering for the first time. I struggled screwing the screws into the corner posts and replacing the DC motor when it broke halfway through my project. I am looking forward to starting my intensive project
